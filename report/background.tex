    \subsection{Musical Notation}
        In order properly to understand the task of reading music, one must understand a few basic terms.

        \subsubsection{Pitch}
            The pitch of a note is referred to by one of the first 7 letters of the alphabet, i.e. \{C,D,E,F,G,A,B\}.
            In scientific pitch notation, a number from 0 - 8 is added after the letter to indicate which octave the note is in.
            The lowest note possible in this notation, C0, represents a sound with frequency 16.35Hz, and the heighest possible, B8, has a frequency 7902.13Hz.
            A4 (frequency 440Hz) is considered an octave lower than A5 (frequency 880Hz), and an increase in octave represents a doubling of frequency in the sound produced.
        \subsubsection{Duration}
            In addition to pitch, notes also encode information about their duration, or how long the sound should be played. 
            Rests indicate an absence of sound. Both these durations are encoded as in Table \ref{table:notes}

            \end{table}
        \subsubsection{Stave}
            A stave comprises five horizontal lines and four spaces. A note can sit either in a space or on a line, and the height of the note dictates its pitch.

            \end{figure}
        \subsubsection{Clef}
            The pitch of a note on a stave is dependent on the Clef appearing at the start of said stave. There are two types, as below.
