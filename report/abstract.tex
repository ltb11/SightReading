We have created Sight Reader, an application which reads and plays sheet music on your Android device.

Optical music recognition has been researched since the 1960s and is still actively researched to this day. However, while almost all existing solutions interpret music captured using a desktop scanner, or from a PDF source, our application is portable and handles photos taken by a mobile device camera. This provides a number of interesting problems and challenges, for example image distortion and lower processing power on mobile devices.

Our solution allows a user to take a photo, or a series of photos, and output them as an industry standard MIDI file, which can be viewed and edited by a range of existing applications. This service would be invaluable for a novice musician trying to learn a challenging new piece, to play the second part of a duet with a soloist who finds themself without a musical companion, or simply to archive a piece of music for later use.
